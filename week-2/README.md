# Learning Log
​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
Reinforced the JavaScript I knew and learned some new commands like && || and <= = >=
​
​
### What Was Hard
Mainly frustrated with my typing and making simple mistakes like typing %% instead of &&. 

​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to ask quetions like why is my code not working or what I was missing to get something to work, like in the switch assignment. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
My brain still struggles with how JS and CSS can refer to eachother and how they can interact. 
Don't quite understand how JS toggles CSS and can swap back and forth between different states.
