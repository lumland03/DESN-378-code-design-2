## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
I learned the basics of JavaScript. I learned how to declare variables using let and const, and how to add to scripts and combine them.
​
​
### What Was Hard
The hard part was trying to understand how different things worked. Learning different commands or code things was also difficult. Trying to manage my mental 
workload was also a challenge between other classes. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
I did not (because I am dumb and also stubborn)
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I need to reinforce what I already know, and start to commit different functions to memory. I am still hazy on some of the code from some of the assignments, and need to
understand rather than just look at it and pretend that I totally understand. I took notes, but I haven't yet memorized the concepts that I wrote down. ​
