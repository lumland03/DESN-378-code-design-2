## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
I learned the basics of JavaScript. I learned how to declare variables using let and const, and how to add to scripts and combine them.
​
​
### What Was Hard
The hard part was trying to understand how different things worked. Learning different commands or code things was also difficult. Trying to manage my mental 
workload was also a challenge between other classes. 
​
​
### How I Used AI
I did not (because I am dumb and also stubborn)
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I need to reinforce what I already know, and start to commit different functions to memory. I am still hazy on some of the code from some of the assignments, and need to
understand rather than just look at it and pretend that I totally understand. I took notes, but I haven't yet memorized the concepts that I wrote down. ​
​
### Work Completed (Week 0)

## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
Javascript was a very new concept for me and felt more like backend coding than coding a website. Some basic commands clicked but a lot of other stuff hasn't yet. ​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
Trying to learn another language that feels nothing like the other two has been very annoying. ​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
I used a lot of AI to understand why some code worked and some did not. It was helpful making stuff look nice and work correctly.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I just need to reinforce the basics and the rest will come with time and practice. ​
​

​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
Reinforced the JavaScript I knew and learned some new commands like && || and <= = >=
​
​
### What Was Hard
Mainly frustrated with my typing and making simple mistakes like typing %% instead of &&. 

​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to ask quetions like why is my code not working or what I was missing to get something to work, like in the switch assignment. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
My brain still struggles with how JS and CSS can refer to eachother and how they can interact. 
Don't quite understand how JS toggles CSS and can swap back and forth between different states. 
​

​
## Week 3 
​
### What I Learned
Learned how to use design tokens and theme switching with JavaScript and CSS. Used figma to create variables and then exported them to CSS.
Learned how to use localStorage to save preferences for themes. ​
​
​
### What Was Hard
My main struggls were trying to understand how figma wanted me to create the variables and trying to figure out why they werent working when I exported them to CSS.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI just to autofill some code here and there, but mainly to help me understand why some of my code wasnt working and what I was missing.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I need more practive with figma so I can fully use the design tokens.
​
​

### Work Completed (Week 3)

**Design Tokens**
- [X] variables.css exists
- [X] Color tokens defined
- [X] Typography tokens defined
- [ ] Spacing tokens defined - Need to create
- [ ] Tokens used in CSS (no hardcoded values) - Halfway there

**Theme System**
- [X] Uses data-theme on <html>
- [X] Toggle feedback is immediate

**Persistence & Preference**
- [X] Theme saved to localStorage
- [X] Theme persists on refresh
- [x] System preference used on first visit

**Deployment**
- [X] Deployed to GitHub Pages
- [X] Repository is public
