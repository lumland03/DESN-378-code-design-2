    <h1>Bee's need more appreciation</h1>
    <img src="images/bee.png" alt="The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth.">

    <p>Bees are not appreciated enough. Here are 3 reasons why they deserve more appreciation:</p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>Cute</li>
      <li>Smart</li>
      <li>Small</li>
    </ul>

    <p>"Bees are vital for the environment because they pollinate about three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and 35% of food crops, enabling plant reproduction, boosting biodiversity, and supporting entire ecosystems by providing food and habitat for other wildlife, helping with soil health, and fighting climate change through plant growth. They ensure food security for humans and animals and help maintain resilient, healthy natural landscapes." </p>
