# Learning Log
​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
Javascript was a very new concept for me and felt more like backend coding than coding a website. Some basic commands clicked but a lot of other stuff hasn't yet. ​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
Trying to learn another language that feels nothing like the other two has been very annoying. ​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
I used a lot of AI to understand why some code worked and some did not. It was helpful making stuff look nice and work correctly.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I just need to reinforce the basics and the rest will come with time and practice. ​
